Welcome to **An interface of Ice and Fire** ‚Äî an application built to help fans of _A Song of Ice and Fire_ keep track of the series' extensive roster of characters and their fates. In a world where allegiances shift and heads roll, this app provides a simple interface to stay updated on the life (or death) status of the sworn members of Westeros' most prominent houses.

## üìú Project Overview

"As an avid fan of the epic series _A Song of Ice and Fire_, I have a hard time keeping up with all of the characters who lose their heads. As such, I would like to have an application that can help me track which characters from the series are alive or dead."

**Data Source:** [An API of Ice and Fire](https://anapioficeandfire.com/)  
**Built With:** Next.js (App Router), with support for pagination, dynamic rendering, and intuitive UI components.
